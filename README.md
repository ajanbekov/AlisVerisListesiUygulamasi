This project is the first application I developed using the Kotlin programming language and is integrated with an SQLite database. The application provides basic shopping list management and features a user-friendly interface. Upon launching the app, the user can enter an item name via an EditText field and add it to the ListView using the adjacent button.
Items added to the ListView can be removed using the delete button located to the right of each item or duplicated using the copy button. Additionally, items can be deleted by long-pressing on the desired item. All these operations are seamlessly executed on the SQLite database, ensuring that the items added by users are accurately reflected and managed within the ListView.
I designed this project as a simple and functional application to gain experience with Kotlin.
